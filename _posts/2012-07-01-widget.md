### Add a performances widget

You can add a button to sell tickets from your own web pages with very little coding. There is a <code>Share as widget</code> button at your show page that will display the instructions: 

<p><img src="/img/widget.png" class="img-polaroid img-rounded"></p>

You can paste this code into your web page, or click the button to try the widget first.

<p><img src="https://github.com/icoloma/koliseo-oss/raw/master/screenshot.png" class="img-polaroid img-rounded"></p>

This widget is open source and its full documentation can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/icoloma/koliseo-oss).
