### Ticket alerts

You will be notified when the number of tickets available for any of your shows falls below a configurable threshold (by default `100,75,50,25,0`). When any of these values is reached (for example with your first ticket sale, or when a performance gets sold out) you will receive a automated notification message.

This list can be configured from your "edit user profile" page. To turn these off, just leave the field empty.
