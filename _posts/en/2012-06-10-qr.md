<h3>What is a QR code?</h3>

QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is a two-dimensional barcode used to encode information. Most cell phones can scan them directly, which makes QR codes a popular way to exchange information.

A more detailed, absolutely scary explanation can be found [at this Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code).

<h3>QR codes in your tickets</h3>

Koliseo uses QR codes to read the localizer of your ticket (the text that can be found at the lower left corner of your ticket page). This QR code can be scanned by [Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie](/android) to validate your ticket, or you can introduce your localizer manually as text.

<h3>Share your event as QR</h3>

You can also generate a QR code from your show page to be included in handouts, packaging, posters or ads. To generate a QR code, click on the ```Share as QR``` button and introduce the expected width of the generated image. Your QR code will be saved to your local disk as a PNG file that when decoded will redirect the smartphone to your show page.
