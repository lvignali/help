There are several ways of sharing your shows. In the <code>Share</code> tab of your Show details page you have some of them.

<div class="row-fluid">
    <ul>
        <li><b>URL</b>: You can change the URL of your event inside Koliseo. Try to keep it short and easy to memorize.</li>
        <li><b>Your website</b>: If you have a website of your own, put it here. It will get linked from the landing page.</li>
        <li><b>Max tickets per user</b>: The maximum number of tickets available to a single user.</li>
        <li><b>Share as QR</b>: Use this to generate a QR pointing to your landing page. QR (Quick Response Code) is a two-dimensional barcode that can be printed offline (in magazines or posters) and can be scanned by most cell phones to get directly to the web page without having to type the web location. A more detailed, absolutely scary explanation can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">at this Wikipedia page</a></li> 
        <li><b>Show available tickets</b>: Activate to display the number of tickets available while purchasing. This is off by default, but you may want to activate it when your tickets are running low to inform your users that they may be left out.</li>
        <li><b>Mark as unlisted</b>: When activated, your events will not be included in Google search or your public profile page.</li>
    </ul>
