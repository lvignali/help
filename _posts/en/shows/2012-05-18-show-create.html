We are here to help you give a good show. In Koliseo we think that you should have an awesome landing page to get the best of your event.

To start the process, click on the <code>Create show</code> link at the top bar.

<h2>Landing page</h2>
    <p>To create a show your first step is to design the landing page. You can edit the title and description by clicking on them (only the title is required, you can leave the description blank). Both are limited to 140 characters, so keep it short and to the point. 
    <p>You can also select the background image from the box that will appear at the top of the page while editing. You can upload your own background images by selecting the last option in this box.

    <p>It's important to use only material that you are authorized to include. If you want to upload new photos or videos you can do that in the Flickr and Youtube websites.

    <p>After filling the title and description, you must specify the date and place where this show is taking place. We call that the performance.
    <p>After clicking the <code>Set date and time</code> button in the landing page, you will be redirected to the Show Details page where you can specify the date, time and location of the performance.

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <p>In this page you can set the price for your performance. You can specify as many ticket types as you need, each with a different price and number of tickets available. 
    <p>The fee charged by Koliseo will get updated as you make changes to these values. You can choose if the end user should see this fee or not by changing the value of the <code>Fee paid by</code> field. Free tickets (set price to zero) will not get charged any fee.
    <p id="fee">The fee is what we use to pay our invoices. We charge 7% (tax included) of the ticket sale price to events that are not free, with 1 EUR/USD minimum and 15 EUR/USD maximum. The fee is calculated automatically and it cannot be modified.
