<h2>What is the cost of using Koliseo?</h2>
<p>Koliseo is free for event organizers. It operates on a fee charged over the ticket price that is paid with the ticket purchase. Everything else, including <a href="/en/tickets/android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</a> for Android, is free.

<h2>What fee does Koliseo apply over the ticket price?</h2>
<p>We charge 7% over the ticket price, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 15 of the event currency (EUR or USD). The following is an example for euros:
<table class="table table-bordered">
	<thead>
		<tr> <th>Ticket price <th>Applicable fee </tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr> <td>between 0.01 and 14 EUR<td>1 EUR</tr>
		<tr> <td>between 15 and 214 EUR<td>7% of the ticket price</tr>
		<tr> <td>above 215 EUR<td>15 EUR</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<h2>What about free events?</h2>
<p>Free tickets are exempt of the minimum fee. If you are not making any income out of your event, we neither.

<h2>Which currencies are supported?</h2>
<p>At the moment we support EUR and USD. Payments are executed in the same currency of the event.

<h2>How do I receive payment for my sold tickets?</h2>
<p>In order to receive payment you must first have introduced your payment data. On your user profile page click <code>Edit</code> and go to the <code>Payment info</code> tab. You can create your show without filling this in, but you will receive a reminder once you have your first payment pending. 
 
<h2>When do I receive payment for my sold tickets?</h2>
<p>Transfers are usually executed during the week after your performance takes place.
