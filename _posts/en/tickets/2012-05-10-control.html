You can validate tickets at the entrance to your event printing the list of sold tickets or by using <a href="../android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie for Android</a>.

<hr>
<h2>Sold tickets</h2>

<p>To prepare a list of sold tickets, select the performances you are interested in the <code>Event Details</code> page and click <code>Sold Tickets</code>.

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span8">

  </div>
</div>

<p>The resulting page will display the selected performances and a list of sold tickets. This table can be sorted by clicking on the header cells. You may print this page (<code>Ctrl + P</code> on Windows, <code>Cmd + P</code> on Mac) and take it to the entrance to your event.

<h2>Security features</h2>

<p> All tickets include the following items to validate at the access control point:
<p>
  <img class="himg" src="/img/tickets/ticket.png">
<ol>
  <li><b>The ticket type</b>: Indicates the type that was purchased. You should confirm it using your printed list or Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie.
  <li><b>The checksum</b>: This field is automatically generated by the platform, and it should be the same that you have in your sold tickets list. Failure to validate this checksum field indicates a forged ticket.
  <li><b>The QR code</b>: contains the checksum value printed in a format that your android device can scan and validate automatically.
</ol>

<p>Tickets do not have to be printed to be valid. You can check in tickets from a cell phone screen all the same, just by using the security features described here.

<p>The number of people indicated in the ticket should appear at the entrance to the event at the same time with the ticket.

<h2>Access control checklist</h2>

<p>The following is the non-exhaustive list of things that you should check at the entrance.

<ul>
  <li><b>Use android</b>: You should try <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koliseo.android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</a> from the Android Market. It makes the ticket validation process much faster, which helps to shorten your queues and make everything happen faster.
  <li><b>Always have a backup</b>: Even if you are using Android, you should have a list of sold tickets printed in case your battery dies, the android device fails, or whatever. You should not rely exclusively on electronics, specially for big events.
  <li><b>Big events, split your queues</b>: In case you are doing it by hand, you should organize your access control by user name (A-M, L-O, etc) to avoid having one single huge queue to resolve. 
  <li><b>Internet Access</b>: You don't need WiFi or 3G while validating tickets with Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie, but that means that you should synchronize your tickets before the event. This is done to prevent Internet access from collapsing during the first minutes of your event (likely to happen in big events).
</ul>

<h2 id="alerts">Ticket alerts</h2>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span8">
    <p>Event organizers will be notified when the number of tickets available falls below a configurable threshold (by default <code>100,75,50,25,0</code>). When any of these values is reached (for example with your first ticket sale, or when a performance gets sold out) the organizer will receive a automated notification message.

    <p>This list can be configured from your <code>Edit user profile</code> page. To turn alerts off, just leave the field empty.
