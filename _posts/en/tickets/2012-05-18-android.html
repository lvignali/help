<h2>Welcome to Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</h2>


<p><a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koliseo.android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</a> is the free Android application that validates tickets for your events. To use this application you must have a working Koliseo account with programmed events. It is important that you log in with the same account used to create the events in the first place. At the moment, this Koliseo account should be an account open through a Google account.

		<p>After a successful login, the list of scheduled events will be synchronized with the server. Once this process has finished you will be able to start validating tickets. Remember to do this process at least once before the event takes place: Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie can run without a working Internet connection, but the list of tickets should be synchronized beforehand. You may also synchronize again after the event to send the number of checked in tickets to the server, for stats purposes.

<h2>Check-in by checksum</h2>

<p>To validate a ticket by its checksum, go to the ticket list and click the search bar. While you introduce the ticket checksum, the list will update automatically to reflect your choice. Then, select the ticket to show its details and do the check in, if you want.

<h2>Check-in by QR code</h2>

<p>You can also validate tickets scanning the QR code from the printed ticket using the camera in your Android device. Just point to the QR code of the ticket with your camera.

<p>Even if you are using Android to validate, you may want to prepare a printed list of sold tickets to take with you, just in case.


<h2>Why the name?</h2>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie">Checkpoint Charlie</a> was the crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. It was a cold night of March and we were lazily wondering a good name. We just reproduced the complex train of thought that made others <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/msg/d1064f7b27808692?pli=1">arrive to 42</a>.
