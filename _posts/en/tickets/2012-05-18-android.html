<h2>Welcome to Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</h2>

<p><a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koliseo.android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie</a> is the free Android application that validates tickets for your events. To use this application you must have a working Koliseo account with programmed events. It is important that you log in with the same account used to create the events in the first place.

	<div class="span3"> <img class="himg" src="/img/android/frontpage.jpg"> </div>
	<div class="span3"> <img class="himg" src="/img/android/login.jpg"> </div>
	<div class="span3"> <img class="himg" src="/img/android/performances.png"> </div>
	<div class="span3"> <img class="himg" src="/img/android/event.jpg"> </div>
</div>

<p>After a successful login, the list of scheduled events will be synchronized with the server. Once this process has finished you will be able to start validating tickets. Remember to do this process at least once before the event takes place: Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie can run without a working Internet connection, but the list of tickets should be synchronized beforehand. You may also synchronize again after the event to send the number of checked in tickets to the server, for stats purposes.

<h2>Check-in by checksum</h2>

<p>To validate a ticket by its checksum, go to the ticket list and click the search button. While you introduce the ticket checksum, the list will update automatically to reflect your choice:

	<div class="span3"> <img class="himg" src="/img/android/by-hand-2.png"> </div>
</div>

<h2>Check-in by QR code</h2>

<p>You can also validate tickets scanning the QR code from the printed ticket using the camera in your Android device. Just align the QR code with the horizontal red line that will appear in your device screen.

	<div class="span6"> <img class="himg" src="/img/android/ko.jpg"> </div>
</div>

<p>Even if you are using Android to validate, you may want to prepare a printed list of sold tickets to take with you, just in case.

<h2>Why the name?</h2>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie">Checkpoint Charlie</a> was the crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. It was a cold night of March and we were lazily wondering a good name. We just reproduced the complex train of thought that made others <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/msg/d1064f7b27808692?pli=1">arrive to 42</a>.
