<p>Other fields in the discount form are:</p>

* **Name**: the identifier of this discount. Your contacts will have to know this name to be able to use this discount, so keep it short and easy to remember - or long and hard to guess, for single-use promotional codes.
* **Expiration date**: The date when this discount will be no longer available. Leave empty if the discount does not expire.
* **Max redemptions**: The maximum number of times this discount code can be redeemed. Set to 1 for single-use discount codes.

<p>When applying a discount greater than the ticket price, the total amount will be set to zero and the Koliseo fee will not be applied.</p>

<h2>Using a discount</h2>

<p>When you are done with the discount, get one ticket (<code>View event</code> â†’ <code>Get tickets</code>) and click the link to introduce a promotional code. If the code is correct, the discount will be deduced automatically.</p>
