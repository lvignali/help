<h2>What is the cost of using Koliseo?</h2>
<p>Koliseo is free for event organizers. It operates on a fee charged over the ticket price that is paid with the ticket purchase. Everything else, including <a href="/en/tickets/android">Koliseo Checkpoint Charlie for Android</a>, is free.

<h2>Who pays the fee?</h2>
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <p>When creating a performance, you can choose if the fee should be paid by the end user or the organizer. If the latter, the ticket buyer will never see the associated fee but it is still visible in the edition page for information purposes (only the organizer can see this page). The column labeled <code>total</code> is the amount that end users will pay for each ticket.

<h2>Fees</h2>

<p>We charge a fee of <b>1€+4%</b> over the ticket price. 

<p>You can choose if you want the ticket buyer or the event organizer to pay the ticket fee. In the first case the fee will be added to the ticket price before paying, in the second the fee will be deducted from the ticket price before transferring the funds to the event organizer. For example: 

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr> <th>Ticket price</th> <th>Fee</th> <th>Fee paid by</th> <th>Paid by user<th>Received by organizer</tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr> <td>10€</td> <td>1.04€</td> <td>Buyer</td> <td>11.04€<td>10€</tr>
    <tr> <td>10€</td> <td>1.04€</td> <td>Organizer</td> <td>10€<td>8.6€</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>What about free events?</h2>
<p>Free tickets are exempt of the minimum fee. If you are not making any income out of your event, we neither.

<h2>Which currencies are supported?</h2>
<p>At the moment we support EUR and USD. Payments are executed in the same currency of the event.
