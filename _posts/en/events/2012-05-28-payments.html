    Koliseo keeps a balance with the accumulated income of any past performance in your account. This balance is available in the <code>Balance</code> tab in your user profile page, which also displays the list of past performances included in the balance. Once your balance gets above 100 EUR (or 100 USD) you can create a payment order to have this amount transferred to your bank account.

    <p>In order to receive payment you must have introduced your payment data. On your user profile page click <code>Edit</code> and go to the <code>Payment info</code> tab. This can be filled in later, in which case you will receive a reminder once you have your first pending payment.
