With some events, you may need invitations to control who assist to your performances, so Koliseo let you send invitations automatically to the guests you want. How can you do this?
  
<hr>
<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span5">
    First of all, you need to go to the <code>Invitations</code> tab of your (already created) performance and check the <code>This performance is by invitation only</code> field. Realize that if you check out this field again, your event will be selling as normal as usual, so you can open the selling to everybody if you see that you are not going to sold out only with invitations.

  <div class="span4">
    Then, if you use the <code>Add invitations</code> button, you will see a form when you can indicate the list of the desired assistants emails. This is the only field required. The rest of them are there to be more specific with the invitation. You do not have only a field <code>Message</code> that let you to add a custom message in the invitation email, but a <code>Discount</code> field to apply automatically when using the invitation and a <code>Expires</code> field to be sure the invitation is used before a specific date. Notice that if you want to specify a discount, the discount has to be created before. Once you have specified all you need, click the <code>Send</code> button and all the invitations will be created on background. All the created invitations will appear in the list showed below, where you will see their state as well as do some actions like resend an invitation or delete one (if it has not yet been used).

    What guests have to do? In the invitation email, they will find info of your event as well as a <code>Get your tickets</code> button that will redirect them to the Koliseo buy page, filling it automatically with the discount specified (if any) and using the appropriate invitation transparently. So, to use an invitation, guests do not have to fill more data than any other user.
