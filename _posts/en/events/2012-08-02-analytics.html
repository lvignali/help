<h2>Configuring Google Analytics</h2>
<p>To enable this feature just go to your Koliseo profile page, click <code>Edit profile</code> and go to the <code>Advanced</code> tab. Introduce your Analytics Tracker ID and click <code>Save</code>.

<p>Right after saving you can check that it has been properly configured using the <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/whats-happening-on-your-site-right-now.html">real-time reports in Google Analytics</a>. Just open the real-time report and your event landing page in another browser tab.

<h2>Recorded data</h2>

<p><img src="/img/events/analytics-chart.png" class="himg">
<p>After your Google Analytics ID has been successfully configured any visit to your events or user profile page will be recorded. You can choose how to take advantage of these statistics:

<ul>
	<li><b>Offline ad campaigns</b> (radio, TV) can be compared with the traffic flow to identify working patterns.
	<li><b>Track online sources</b> such as blogs and social networks linking to your event page.
	<li><b>Correlate pricing</b> to changes in your conversion rate.
	<li><b>Analyze the events that are getting most attention</b> and identify why.
	<li><b>Compare your weekly increase</b> of traffic
</ul>
