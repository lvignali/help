There are several ways of sharing your events. In the <code>Share</code> tab of your Event details page you have some of them.

<div class="row-fluid">
    <ul>
        <li><b>URL</b>: You can change the location of your event at Koliseo. Try to keep it short and easy to memorize.</li>
        <li><b>Your website</b>: If you have your own website, put it here to get it linked from the landing page.</li>
        <li><b>Max tickets per user</b>: The maximum number of tickets available to a single user. The default is 10.</li>
        <li><b>Show available tickets</b>: Activate to display the number of tickets available while purchasing. This is off by default, but you may want to activate it when your tickets are running low to inform your users that they may be left out.</li>
        <li><b>Mark as unlisted</b>: When activated, your events will not be included in Google search or on your public profile page.</li>
        <li><b>Notify sales</b>: When checked you will be notified by e-mail each time a ticket for this event is sold.</li>
    </ul>
