<p>So, your event is already set up. Congratulations! There is a huge list of things to keep track of even for the most seasoned of experts, so we thought about keeping a checklist for you, just in case.

<p>This is a long list. The points here apply to professional events (conferences et al) of all sizes, small to big. Some will probably not apply to you.

<h3>Before the event</h3>

<p>A list of things that you should do before the event takes place.

<h4>6-3 months before</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>Secure the venue</b>: you need a place to send all these people to, right?
  <li><b>Contact sponsors</b>: it helps if you are able of showing a demographics study of previous years, not just the number of people that attended but also the composition: roles, ages, etc.
  <li><b>Contact speakers</b>: you should contact any star speakers at least with 90 says of anticipation. These guys got busy schedules.
  <li><b>Tell the media</b>: it doesn't matter if it's a local newspaper or just a cool blogger that owes you some beers. Tell everybody more than once.
  <li><b>Use social networks</b>: You really don't need us to tell you this, right? Use different times of the day and repeat the message a couple of times, rewording differently. Share on weekend and on labor days, as some people read news on a different schedule.
  <li><b>You need a website</b>: It doesn't matter if it's something elaborate or just a <a href="http://launchrock.co/">launch page</a>. You need somewhere to send people to. Try to go with something that you can reuse on following years.
  <li><b>Powerpoint template for presentations</b>: for professional events, you should consider if you want to provide your speakers with a common template to use, but it should be optional in any case. Many speakers are so much better at designing slides than you are (in fact, sometimes that's the point).
  <li><b>Code of conduct</b>: It may seem silly to some, but sexual harrassment has happened in events before, and people have lost their jobs for this reason. Leave a clear message about how speakers and attendees are expected to behave during your events.
</ul>

<h4>Three months before the event</h4>

<ul>
  <li><b>Bags</b>: If you are giving away schwag and merchandising from your sponsors, you will need a bag. 
  <li><b>Ask sponsors for merchandising</b>: you know, for the bags.
  <li><b>T-shirts</b>: With the registration form you may ask for the T-shirt size, or just use statistics from previous years adding a 10% deviation.
  <li><b>Lodging for key speakers<b>: Go with some place that is walking distance for the venue, if you don't want to have to pick them up before the event.
</ul>

<h3>During the event</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Plan for no-shows</b>: sometimes registered people just cannot attend. This gets specially important for free events, where typically 20-40% of registered attendees will not show. These numbers experience a significant drop if you ask for a symbolic registration fee instead (like 5$) that you can use later to crowdfund a Strawberry Beer Party.
</ul>

<h3>After the event</h3>

<h3>Saving money</h3>

<p>Resources are scarce. There are some places where it's stupid to spend money, and there are others where you cannot avoid spending money.

<h4>Where you can save money</h4>

<p><b>Bags</b>: Counterintitive as it may seem, most people prefer cheap plastic bags instead of something fancier like cloth bags or even backpacks. They take less space, they can be recycled, and people (specially frequent event attenders) don't feel like they are taking trash home.
<p><b>Food</b>: It's complicated. If you want to run on a very low budget and there are a lot of places nearby, you can remove food entirely from the program and leave everyone on their own. Otherwise, the cheapest options are typically pizza or locally-produced food: kebab, potatoes, rice. Look for the typical products that you would consume on the street. 
<p><b>T-Shirts</b>: If you are printing more than 500 T-shirts, take a second to <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=t-shirts+made+in+china">search for a chinese supplier</a>. They are easier to contact than you may think.
<p><b>Speakers</b>: Chances are you have great local speakers that you can rely on. Speking is a great opportunity for them to gain visibility and build their own CV, and also local speakers are less complicated from a logistics point of view: transport and lodging are typically a non-issue. Local or not, if budget is an issue you can stay away from speakers that are being paid to talk.
<p><b>Volunteers</b>: You can ask for volunteers from local universities and associations. Typically they should get some special schwag, have the opportunity to attend some talks, and have some get-together meal or beers. Treat them with care if you want to have volunteers next year.
<p><b>Venues</b>: Depending on the size, you can ask different venues to host your event: small bars or cafeterias, co-working spaces or universities. For bigger audiences, alternative venues (like a reformed slaughterhouse or industrial building) are typically cheaper and will give the event a nice indie style. You may also try to contact small cinemas out of projection times.
<p><b>Access badges</b>: You can print them on paper and use plastic cover or go with carton and no cover (maybe with stickers).
<p><b>After-party</b>: Look for a place where you can host so many people and try to get a discount, but keep in mind that price may be associated to food or drink quality.

<h4>Where you cannot save money</h4>

<p><b>Professional help</b>: you need professionals for audio and video recordings. If you want to have some real-time streaming, ask the video guys if they can do it for you.
<p><b>Food</b>: It's complicated. If you decide to include catering, go with a provider that can deliver meals for hundreds of people in half an hour (typically in a self-service fashion) or go with a cold buffet.
<p><b>Water</b>: You need abundant water for both speakers and attendees.
<p><b>Lodging and transport for key speakers</b>: Seriously, don't forget about that and don't leave them to their own means.
<p><b>More speakers</b>: for events where the ticket price is above 700€ you should consider paying each speaker at least 50% of the ticket price as a compensation.
<p><b>Speakers lunch/dinner</b>: you should get all speakers together, either before or after the event. Keep in mind that some speakers may come from out of town. You can pay for this meal by selling a limited number of VIP tickets that include the right to attend this lunch and meet the speakers.
