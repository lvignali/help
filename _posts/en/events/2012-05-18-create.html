We are here to help you give a good show. In Koliseo we think that you should have an awesome landing page to get the best of your event.

To start the process, click on the <code>Create event</code> link at the top menu bar.

    <h2>Landing page</h2>
    <p>Your first step is to design the landing page. You can edit the title and description by clicking on them (only the title is required, you can leave the description blank). Both are limited to 140 characters, so keep it short and to the point. 
    <p>You can also select the background image from the box at the top of the page. The last option in this box allows you to specify your own photo to use as background. It is important to use only material that you are authorized to include.

    <p>After filling the title and description, you must specify the date and place where this event is taking place. We call that the performance.
    <p>After clicking the <code>Set where and when</code> button in the landing page, you will be redirected to the Event Details page where you can specify the date, time and location of the performance. You can use the name of the venue as location, as most well-known venues are recognized and displayed correctly in the map.

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <p>Your performance may have as many ticket types as you need, each with a different price and number of tickets on sale. 
    <p>The fee charged by Koliseo will get updated as you make changes to these values. You can choose if the end user should see this fee or not by changing the value of the <code>Fee paid by</code> field. Free tickets (where the price is zero) will not get charged any fee.
    <p id="fee">The fee is what we use to pay our invoices. We charge 9% (tax included) of the ticket sale price to events that are not free, with 1 EUR/USD minimum and 15 EUR/USD maximum. The fee is calculated automatically and it cannot be modified. <a href="../fees">More details here</a>.

    <p>There is a mini button at the top right corner of the ticket types table to display the dates of availability of each ticket type. This way you can set up a price for early buyers until a certain date is reached, and a different price afterwards. Both values are optional, you may leave any of them empty.

<h2>Ticket type description</h2>
<p>There is a link to enter a description below each ticket type. This is a text that will be displayed during the entire purchase process together with the end of availability of this ticket type, if any. Ticket types that are not yet available will not be displayed at all.

    <p>Imagine that you had a mistake when creating the performances or you are having such a problem that obligue you to stop selling tickets for all the performances of your event. You can do it in the landing page of your event. You will see a <code>Stop Selling</code> button that will forbid all buying attempt while the issue is being solved. Once the issue is solved, use the <code>Resume Selling</code> button to continue selling as usual.
    <p>We pray you will never need this feature.

    <p>There are events that have multiple performances that only differ on their date. If that is your case, you can create a first performance and then, using the <code>Clone</code> tab, you can create multiple performances based on the current one. First of all, specify the dates where your new performances are going to take place. Then, indicate the days of the week between this days when you really want to create those performances. And it is over! Once you click the <code>Clone</code> button, your performance will be cloned only changing its date by the new ones. Of course, you can edit them if any other data should be changed.
